# Hashtables
### Overview
The purpose of this presentation is to expand upon the previous presenations on hash tables by showcasing a range of use cases for hash functions. 

Our presentation includes:
- Cybersecurity: A demo using SHA-256 hash function
- Abstract uses for hash functions 

### SHA-256 and Cybersecurity
Hashing.ipynb seeks to explore some of the use cases for hashing, particularly with the common SHA-256. It provides insight into how the data is stored, but then shifts gears to talk about how these measures may not help during security breaches and bring awareness to the cybersecurity implications.
