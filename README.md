### Overview
In previous presenatations, we covered the basic structure of hash tables and the utility of thehash function.
In our final presentation, we hope to expand upon the uses for hash tables by showcasing the broad applications of hash functions. We start with a practical use case in cybersecurity and go through a demo of the SHA-256 hash function, followed by a demo of a more abstract application.

### SHA-256 and Cybersecurity

Hashing.ipynb seeks to explore some of the use cases for hashing, particularly with the common SHA-256. It provides insight into how the data is stored, but then shifts gears to talk about how these measures may not help during security breaches and bring awareness to the cybersecurity implications.
